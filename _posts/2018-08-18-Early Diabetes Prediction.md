## Introduction

Machine Learning Techniques are gaining a lot of momentum in constant improvement of disease diagnosis. In this study, we have 
investigated the discriminative performance of ensemble learning model for diabetes prediction at an early stage. We have used 
different machine learning models and then ensemble it to improve the overall prediction accuracy. The dataset used is 
NHANES 2013-14 comprising of 10,172 samples and 54 feature variables for diabetes section. The feature variables used are in the
form of questionnaire, a set of questions suggested by NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). 
An Ensemble model using majority voting technique was developed by combining the unweighted prediction probabilities of different
machine learning models. Also, the model is evaluated and validated for real user input data for user friendliness. The overall 
performance was improved by Ensemble Model and had an AUC (Area under Curve) of 0.75 indicating high performance.
